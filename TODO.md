# Things to do

1. Add handling for missing data in stream histories
2. Pull the date/time field into StreamHistories for plots etc
3. Add proper mass balance recon algorithm
4. Should stream histories detect the steps or should this be done externally and the periods between steps/ramps etc fed to a stream history? And them reconciled seperately?
5. Wrap the code into a package
6. Create Active and Passive UnitOps - Passive is the current on. Active takes a transformation to generate the outlet streams for the inlets.
7. Turn the thing into a package
8. ?
